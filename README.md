# Pulse-rate-prediction-using-KNN-Algorithm
AIM:
• Report on creating a pulse monitoring system using a pulse rate
sensor and deploying it in hardware

MATERIAL REQUIRED:
• ESP.
• IOT cloud.
• Connecting wires.
• Laptop
• Sensors.

PROCEDURE:
• Collect the data as per our requirement and transfer the data from
the ESP to the sensors.
• Then transfer the data from sensors to Pycharm IDE.
• After applying the code for it, run with regression which is required
for the data.
• Then, transfer the regression data to the IOT cloud, which will
helpful for controlling the data from anywhere.
• Finally, use the IOT cloud data and send it to the dashboard for the
final results.
